# proteinHMM

This program uses BioPython perform a BLASTp search over the internet, clustal Omega to perform Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), and BioPython to construct a phylogenetic tree for analysis of the FMR1 gene. 

The data sets generated from the BLASTp search are used to train protein HMMs that perform log-Viterbi score calculations.


### Prerequisites/Assumptions

Dependencies:
* Python 3+ 
* BioPython
* MatPlotLib
* Clusta Omega .exe
* Java
